# Introduction

This ongoing project aims to provide a foundation for understanding how plugins in MkDocs work by examining exemplary code.

Documentation is underway. This is early work in progress.

If you stumble upon this and find some use for this plugin, please send me a star. This is my first open project.

## TODO
- [x] PyPi package
- [ ] make github worklow for documentation building
    - [ ] allow to build without first manual deployment
    - [ ] make github workflow for plugin usage example
- [ ] test out the plugin
- [x] fix theming of documentation
